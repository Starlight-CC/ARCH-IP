                  ISPCP - Inter Server Packet Control Protocol

Introduction:
    ISPCP is a peer to peer communication control protocol used for
    communication with an ARCH-IP provider server, this protocol is used to
    configure the ARCH-IP connection with the provider.
    
Overview:
    ISPCP is a simple protocol that contains three fields: "Protocol", "Payload
    length" and "Payload". This protocol is used to expand data communication to
    more complicated protocols like ARCH-IP and specific configuration protocols
    to setup the ARCH-IP connection to the routing server.
    
Technical specification:
    The "Protocol" field is 1 byte, the "Payload length" field is 2 bytes, and
    the "Payload" field is a variable size ranging between 0 and 2^16-3 bytes.
    The protocol field tells the server how to handle the data, payload length
    describes the length of the payload; the payload may be any data. In all
    supported protocols, byte order is always low to high.
    
Protocols:
    The supported protocols depends on the service being accessed, thought a
    global protocol of 0 is always supported. Protocol 0 is for ARCH-IP packets,
    where the payload will contain the ARCH-IP packet.
