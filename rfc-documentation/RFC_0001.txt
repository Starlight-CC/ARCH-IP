           ARCH-IP - An Interserver Computercraft Networking Protocol

Introduction:
    ARCH-IP is a system for sending packets of data to and from Computercraft
    computers both within a Minecraft server and between Computercraft computers
    on two different Minecraft servers. ARCH-IP allows for inter-server
    networking via the use of a primary Websocket server, which will be referred
    to as the Backend Server, which will facilitate packet transmission between
    Hub Computers on each Minecraft server connected to the network. The Central
    System will also manage ARCH-DNS (Domain Name System), which allows for IP
    Addresses to be assigned a human friendly Domain Name, like "test.com". The
    ARCH-IP network is also designed to allow other protocols to be built on top
    of it, which allows many different types of network traffic to co-exist on
    the same network. The rest of this document will go into detail on how the
    ARCH-IP networking system works, and how it can be implemented.

Terminology:
    Following this is a list of terms used in this document to describe ARCH-IP
    and it's components, along with their definitions. Backend Server
    -   Is a Websocket server that acts as the central connection point for
        the whole network. All packets whos sender and recipients are on
        different Minecraft servers have to go through this Websocket server.
    Hub Computer
    -   Is a special computer in every Minecraft server connected to the
        ARCH-IP network that is connected to the Backend Server. There must be
        only ONE Hub Computer in a given Minecraft server, and it must ALWAYS be
        running while that Minecraft server is in operation. In order to
        transmit a packet to another Minecraft server, the packet must first be
        sent to the Hub Computer on the Sender's server.
    Node Computer
    -   Is a computer connected to the ARCH-IP network. Each Node must have a
        unique IP Address, which will be used to tell the network which node
        sent a packet and which node a packet needs to go to
    IP Address
    -   Is a unique address that referes to a specific Node Computer. IP
        ddresses are 32 bits and are written in the format W.X.Y.Z, where W, X,
        Y, and Z are numbers ranging from 0 to 255. IP Addresses can either be
        Static or Dynamic. Static IP Addresses are permanently assigned to one
        Node, wheras Dynamic IP Addresses are temporarily assigned to a Node and
        only last for a single network session.
    Domain Name
    -   Is a human friendly name assigned to an IP Address. Domain names can
        only be assigned to Static IPs, and consist of two parts: the Top Level
        Domain (or TLD), and the Server Name, which are seperated by a dot, such
        as "server.com". the TLD is used to specify the category of server that
        the client is accessing (which goes after the dot), and the Server Name
        is used to specify which specific server the client is accessing.
    Network Packet
    -   Is the smallest unit of data sent over the ARCH-IP network. Every
        packet consists of the following information: ARCH Version (2 Bytes),
        Target IP (4 Bytes), Source IP (4 Bytes), Protocol Number (2 bytes),
        Packet Length (2 Bytes), Payload (1-65522 Bytes). The maximum total
        Packet length is 65,536 bytes, including the header. To send more than
        65,522 Bytes, you will need to split your transmission across two or
        more packets, and include information in your protocol spec to tell the
        different packets apart.

IP Address Structure and Assignment:
    IP address consist of three parts, written as W.X.Y.Z. Each of W, X, Y, and
    Z range from 0-255. W and X indicates the interface hub where the Node
    Computer is located, Y indicates the "Network Block" of the Node, and Z
    singles out a specific Node. Server Networks IDs are assigned by the Backend
    Server, and in order to add an interface hub to the network. Within a
    Minecraft Server, the Operator(s) of the server will be able to assign
    Network Blocks and IP Address on the Hub Computer. Each Network Block can be
    assigned as one of two types: Static Blocks, and Dynamic Blocks. Static
    Blocks can have Static IP Addresses manually assigned by the Hub Operators.
    Dynamic Blocks are open for Dynamic IP Addresses to be assigned to them
    automatically.
